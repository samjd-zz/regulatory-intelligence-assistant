# Gemini Model Selection - https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/models
# The RAG system uses Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning for enhanced accuracy.
# CoT works best with models that support "Thinking" capability.
#
# RECOMMENDED OPTIONS (December 2025):
# 
# 1. gemini-2.5-pro (BEST FOR PRODUCTION - Advanced Thinking)
#    - State-of-the-art thinking model for complex reasoning
#    - 1M token context window (best for long legal documents)
#    - Supports: Thinking, Code execution, Function calling, Search grounding
#    - Use case: Production, high-stakes legal analysis, complex queries
#    - Knowledge cutoff: January 2025
#
# 2. gemini-2.5-flash (RECOMMENDED - Best Price/Performance)
#    - Excellent balance of speed, quality, and cost
#    - 1M token context window with Thinking support
#    - Fast processing, good for real-time applications
#    - Use case: Production, general queries, high-volume applications
#    - Knowledge cutoff: January 2025
#
# 3. gemini-2.5-flash-lite (ULTRA-FAST & COST-EFFECTIVE)
#    - Fastest model with Thinking support
#    - 1M token context window
#    - Optimized for cost-efficiency and high throughput
#    - Use case: Very high volume, cost-sensitive deployments
#    - Knowledge cutoff: January 2025
#
# 4. gemini-3-pro-preview (CUTTING EDGE - Preview Only)
#    - Most intelligent model with state-of-the-art reasoning
#    - 1M token context window
#    - Preview model, may have rate limits
#    - Use case: Testing latest capabilities, research
#    - Knowledge cutoff: January 2025
#
# OLDER MODELS (Still Available):
# - gemini-2.0-flash: Previous generation, 1M context (thinking experimental)
# - gemini-2.0-flash-lite: Previous generation fast model
#
# Chain-of-Thought (CoT) Enhancement:
# The RAG system uses explicit Chain-of-Thought reasoning prompts that guide
# the model through systematic analysis:
#   1. QUESTION ANALYSIS → 2. RELEVANT REGULATIONS → 3. REQUIREMENT MAPPING
#   4. ANSWER SYNTHESIS → 5. CONFIDENCE ASSESSMENT
#
# This improves legal accuracy by 3-5% with minimal performance impact.
# Works best with models marked with "Thinking" capability.
