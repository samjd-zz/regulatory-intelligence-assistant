# Cline Rules for Regulatory Intelligence Assistant

## Project Overview
This is the **Regulatory Intelligence Assistant for Public Service** - an AI-powered platform to help navigate complex laws, policies, and regulations (G7 GovAI Challenge - Statement 2).

## Core Principles

### 1. Legal Accuracy & Reliability
- Legal interpretations must be verifiable with source citations
- Always provide confidence scores for recommendations
- Human expert review for high-stakes decisions
- Clear disclaimers about AI limitations
- Maintain audit trails for all queries and responses

### 2. Regulatory Compliance & Authority
- Only reference official, authoritative legal sources
- Verify content authenticity with cryptographic signatures
- Track legislative changes and amendments
- Version control for all regulatory content
- Maintain legal precedent database

### 3. Explainability & Transparency
- Cite specific sections, clauses, and amendments
- Explain reasoning with legal references
- Provide alternative interpretations when ambiguous
- Flag conflicts between regulations
- Show confidence levels for all recommendations

### 4. User Accessibility & Support
- Plain language explanations for complex legal concepts
- Guided workflows for common processes
- Multi-language support for bilingual services
- Context-aware help based on user role
- Progressive disclosure (simple → detailed)

## Development Guidelines

### Legal NLP Standards
- Fine-tune models on government legal corpus
- Preserve legal terminology and formatting
- Handle cross-references and citations accurately
- Detect semantic relationships between regulations
- Maintain legal document structure

### Knowledge Graph Design
- Comprehensive relationship mapping (references, amendments, dependencies)
- Temporal versioning for regulatory changes
- Cross-jurisdictional connections
- Program and service mappings
- Precedent and case law integration

### Search & Retrieval
- Hybrid search (keyword + semantic + graph traversal)
- Faceted filtering (jurisdiction, date, program, etc.)
- Relevance ranking with legal context
- Citation-aware result presentation
- Query reformulation for legal terminology

### Code Quality
- Unit tests with legal expert validation
- Integration tests for end-to-end workflows
- Accuracy benchmarks against test cases
- Performance tests for response times
- Security tests for access controls

## Technology Constraints
- **Frontend**: React with accessible design
- **Backend**: Python FastAPI for legal NLP
- **AI**: BERT/RoBERTa fine-tuned on legal text, Gemini API for RAG
- **Knowledge Graph**: Neo4j for regulatory relationships
- **Search**: Elasticsearch + vector database (Pinecone/Weaviate)
- **Database**: PostgreSQL for metadata

## Key Features to Prioritize
1. Regulatory knowledge graph
2. Legal NLP engine (entity extraction, intent classification)
3. RAG system with Gemini API
4. Semantic search across regulations
5. Compliance checking engine
6. Guided workflows for common scenarios

## Testing Requirements
- Validate against expert-labeled test queries
- Test with real government use cases
- Accuracy testing (precision/recall on legal Q&A)
- Legal expert review of recommendations
- User acceptance testing with caseworkers

## What NOT to Do
- Don't provide legal interpretations without citations
- Don't claim certainty when regulations are ambiguous
- Don't skip version control for regulatory content
- Don't ignore conflicts between regulations
- Don't deploy without legal expert validation
- Don't mix personal opinions with legal facts

## Success Criteria
- Search accuracy: >75% precision and recall
- Response time: <3 seconds for queries
- Citation accuracy: 100% verifiable sources
- User confidence: 80% report increased confidence
- Time savings: 60-75% reduction in research time
- Consistency: 80% reduction in decision inconsistencies
